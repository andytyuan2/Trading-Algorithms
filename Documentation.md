# Documentation for the pair trading algorithm I am making from scratch

### I plan to use libraries such as numpy and yfinance
Topics that I will use will likely be: 
- geometric brownian motion
- monte carlo simulations

## Steps that I am currently planning now:
1. obtain a historical price list of a specific sector
   a. Might need to make a file that has a master list of sectors and companies in the sectors tbh lol
